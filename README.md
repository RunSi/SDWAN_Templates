# SDWAN Templates
**Feature and Device Template creation with SDWAN API**

Currently **work in progress**.  

This repository will finally have a suite of JSON Feature and Device Template payloads for Cisco SDWAN API calls.

JSON Payloads can be modified in order to customise the templates for your particular use case.

The script create_template.py, is a very simple script to demonstrate the creation of a feature template.
